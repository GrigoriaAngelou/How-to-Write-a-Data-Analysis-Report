        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> 1. Start with a vision</h2>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> If you start writng without having a clear idea of what your data analysis report is going to include, it might get messy and confused. Important insights of your data might got forgotten and  the main structure can be disoriented. To avoid this, you should start with a clear view of how you want your report to be. Plan the structure and the contents first, to achieve a good structured report that covers all the topics that you want to point out.&nbsp;<br>
        </p>
        <h2 class="u-text u-text-3"> 2. Use only Vital KPI’s
Use your KPIs wise.</h2>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4"> Do not overdue with them. You should use only the relevant KPIs for the department that the report is going to made for. Discuss the purpose of this dashboard in a meeting with your team but if it is for other executives just focus on the most relevant KPIs.</p>
        <h2 class="u-text u-text-5"> 3. Pick the Right Chart</h2>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-9"> 5. Organize the Information</h2>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-10"> Before you start your report you have to choose how it is going to be organized. The best practices typically involve starting with the more general information and then dive into details if necessary.</p>
        <h2 class="u-text u-text-11"> 6. Include a Summary</h2>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-12"> A summary at the beginning of a report can help the reader to get familiar with the subjects of the report and even if they do not have time to read the whole report will have a quick idea of the center image of it.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Tip: Even if the summary is usually placed at the beggining of a report, it is best to be written when you have finished writting the whole report.&nbsp;

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-3"> 8. Use Interactive Dashboards </h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-4"> The way that you represent your data can make or break a presentation, regardless of how valuable are your insights. Making a great visual report can automatically update your data and display it in an interesting way.</p>
